# Spotidoro

This app combines a Pomodoro timer with Spotify. It plays music from a Spotify playlist when you are focusing, and pauses the music when it's time for a break.

Beware, this is a very hacky proof-of-concept, stitched together with code borrowed from: https://freshman.tech/pomodoro-timer/ and https://github.com/makeratplay/SpotifyWebAPI
